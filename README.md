# International Space Cafe
Coffee Among the Stars; A Simple MERN Project.

### Project Description:
The International Space Cafe Website aims to create a unique online platform for a space-themed cafe that combines elements of technology, and community engagement. Inspired by the concept of cafes being hubs for programmers and tech enthusiasts, the International Space Cafe will offer not just a menu of galactic-themed drinks and snacks but also a digital space for discussion and problem-solving.

### Key Features:

Space-themed Design: The website will feature a visually captivating space-themed design.

Community Forum: Building on the stereotype of programmers frequenting cafes, the platform will host a community forum where users can discuss programming issues, seek advice, and share solutions. 

User Authentication and Database Integration: To enable features like user profiles and forum participation, the website will implement user authentication using a MongoDB database. Users can create accounts, log in, and track their contributions to the community.

Cosmic Dust Reward System: As a unique twist, users will earn "Cosmic Dust" for actively participating in the forum, contributing solutions, and helping others. Accumulated Cosmic Dust can be exchanged for rewards, such as discounts on cafe purchases or even free beverages.
